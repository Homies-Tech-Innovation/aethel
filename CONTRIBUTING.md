# 🧩 Contributing to Aethel

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Aethel**! We're excited to have you as part of our community.

## 🎯 How to Contribute

We use a **sprint-based development workflow**. Issues are released in batches as we progress through different phases of the project.

### Finding Issues to Work On

- **Only work on issues labeled `help-wanted`** — these are the tasks currently open for community contributions.
- Issues are organized into sprints, and we release `help-wanted` issues as each sprint becomes active.
- If you don't see many open issues right now, it means we're working on the current sprint internally. **Star the repository** to get notified when new issues are released.

> [!IMPORTANT] > **Do not ask to be assigned issues from future sprints.** We release issues progressively to ensure quality and proper sequencing.

### Claiming an Issue

1. **Comment on the issue** to request assignment.
2. Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you.
3. Once assigned, you have **24 hours** to open a pull request.
4. If no PR is submitted within 24 hours, the issue will be reassigned to someone else.

## 🏅 Duplicate PRs

If multiple contributors submit PRs for the same issue, high-quality and genuine efforts may still be tagged as  
`hacktoberfest-accepted` — even if not merged — after review by maintainers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Clone** your fork locally and create a branch named:  
   `<concise-name>/issue-<issue-number>`
3. **Commit and push** your changes.
4. **Open a PR** and fill in the PR template thoroughly.

## 🌟 Getting Priority Review

To receive faster feedback:

- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/HP2YPGSrWU) to discuss your ideas directly with maintainers.
- GitHub comment sections may receive slower responses.
- Ensure you've reviewed the **Discord Rules** outlined in [README.md](./README.md) before joining.

## 📘 Documentation

All application architecture and design decisions are documented in our `docs/` folder.  
Before starting on an issue, we recommend:

- Reading the relevant documentation for context.
- Understanding the overall architecture and patterns we follow.
- Asking questions in Discord if anything is unclear.

Following our documentation ensures your contributions align with the project's vision and increases the likelihood of your PR being merged.

## 💡 Pro Tip

Read through the project documentation and existing issues before starting your contribution.  
Understanding the context makes your PRs stronger, more aligned, and more likely to be merged quickly.

Together, we're building a smarter, more delightful writing experience — welcome aboard!
